#####     DATABASE POSTGRES API     #####

#   - Run this script on the stored data instances in the PostgresSQL database at the same time as
#     the kafka-producer and flink-processor are doing their work and inserting new real-time
#     instances to PostgresSQL.

# This script does 3 things:
#   1) Connects to the postgres container's SQL database
#   2) Runs queries on the database
#   3) Writes the data to the corresponding city csvs in "/generated-artifacts/csvs"


# Prerequisites to running this script:
#   - All dependencies installed            (Check "/instructions-executions/executions/1. install-requirements.sh")
#   - All containers up and running         (Check "/instructions-executions/executions/2. real-time-streaming.sh")
