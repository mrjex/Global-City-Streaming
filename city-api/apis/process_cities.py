# TODO - Idea:
#   - Add this as a 'middleware' layer of the "/city-api" container
#   - The purpose of this 'middleware' layer would be to serve as the
#     place where the APIs in "/apis" or the .sh scripts invokes
#     external functionalities. Then, @countryCodeApi.py could also
#     be rewritten/reframed as a middleware layer. An alternative
#     idea is to put this file in "/shared/weather"
