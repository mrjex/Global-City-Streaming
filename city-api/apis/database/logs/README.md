# Logs

This folder only stores the .json files that would be returned as a response for different queries. The contents of these JSON files be reflected in the parent directorie's 'current-query-response.json' when using the system yourself, and that's where I've coded it so that the rest of the system is only checking that script. Hence, the only purpose of this sub-folder is to easily be able to demonstrate all of the distinct queries that I've implemented.


- "/logs" --> A folder that stores the latest query executions that the developer performed using this 'debug-apiS'
