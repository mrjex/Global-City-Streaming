# System Instructions & Executions

This sub-direcotry is for the developers that desire to interact with the system and generate or analyize data. You'll notice that there are two folders `descriptive` and `executionary`, which contains different file formats. All of these contained files are divided into a 5-part tutorial on how to get started with the system, where the *descriptive* ones describes the setup process in textual format in pdf files, whereas the *executionary* are about running the system and automating processes. It's worth noting that this entire subdirectory was used for the 1st development phase of this project (June 2024), as outlined in [Development Process](../docs/README-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md). In other words, these tutorials are based on [Architecture V1](../docs/README-ARCHITECTURE-V1.md). Although this is the previous version of the project, there are still many similarities, which renders this directory as partially useful still. If you want to learn more about the current architecture and state of the project, navigate to [Architecture V2](../docs/README-ARCHITECTURE-V2.md) which was developed in the 2nd development phase (April 2025)
