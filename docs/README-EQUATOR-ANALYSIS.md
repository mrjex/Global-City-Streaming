# ðŸŒ¡ Equator Distance Temperature Analysis

## Hypothesis
> The closer to the equator a city is, the higher the average temperature is

In essence, this project explores and validates this hypothesis through data analysis and mathematical modeling. Below, the formula which I came up with for plotting a logarithmic trend for the expected temperature, making it adjustable to a fixed value as the maximal Y-value. I had a hypothesis that the closer to the equator that a geopgraphical location is, the hotter the temperature generally is. But I didn't assume this trend to be linear, but rather have a similar curvature as `general learning or progression curves`, in the sense when an individual starts with a pursuit of becoming great at something, that person experience significant and visible progression in the beginning, but that apparent progress wears off over time, and instead of improving 10% per week as one did in the beginning, only a 0.1% improvement is `actualized`. Furthermore, in the context of that particular project, I inituitively made the assumption that cities closer to the north and south poles of Earth (the ones furthest away from the equator) are colder, but they aren't `that much colder`. For instance, Sweden, which is close to the north pole is `undoutebly` colder than Spain, and the difference in temperature isn't of the expected magnitude. Hence, I concluded that a linear relationship between a geographical location's distance to the equator (X) and it's temperature (Y) shouldn't be expressed as a linear relationship.


## Geographic Basis
![lat-long-earth](../docs/readme-pictures/equator/1.%20latitude-longitude-earth.gif)

Key concepts:
- Equator is at latitude 0Â°
- Total latitude range: -90Â° to 90Â°
- Distance to equator = absolute value of latitude

## Mathematical Analysis

### Theoretical Foundation
The relationship between temperature and equator distance follows a logarithmic pattern based on:

1. **Theoretical Reasoning:** Improvements are relative to prior state
2. **Mathematical Reasoning:** Return on investment decreases with progress
3. **General Real-World Application:** Follows standard deviation patterns
