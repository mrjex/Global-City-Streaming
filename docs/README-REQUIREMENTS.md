# Requirements Engineering

This document outlines the key requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria for the Global City Streaming project, which processes and visualizes real-time weather data from cities worldwide.

## Functional Requirements

The system shall:
1. Collect real-time weather data from multiple cities worldwide
2. Process and analyze temperature data in relation to cities' distances from the equator
3. Visualize weather data through interactive maps and charts
4. Store historical weather data in a database with caching
5. Generate automated reports and visualizations in different formats

## Non-Functional Requirements

The system shall:
1. Maintain a maximum response time of 2 seconds for real-time data retrieval
2. Handle concurrent data processing for at least 1000 cities simultaneously
3. Achieve 99.9% uptime for the data streaming pipeline
4. Implement secure API authentication and data encryption for all sensitive information
5. Scale horizontally to accommodate increasing number of monitored cities without performance degradation

## User Stories

As a user, I want to:
1. View real-time temperature data for any city on an interactive map, so I can understand current weather conditions globally
2. Compare weather patterns between different cities based on their distance from the equator, so I can validate temperature-latitude relationships
3. Generate customized reports with specific city pools and time ranges, so I can analyze historical weather trends
4. Access the system through a responsive web interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices, so I can monitor weather data on the go

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Data Accuracy and Freshness
   - Weather data must be updated for each request to the kafka-flink pipeline
   - Temperature values must be accurate within ±0.5°C
   - System must indicate timestamp of last data update

2. Visualization Performance
   - Maps must render within 3 seconds with full city data
   - Color themes must be consistent across all charts
   - Interactive elements must respond within 1 second
   - Charts must be exportable in PNG format

3. System Reliability
   - Data loss during processing must be less than 0.1%
   - System must maintain data consistency across all storage layers
   - Health checks of containers must clearly indicate the current operating states
